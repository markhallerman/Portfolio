# Portfolio

Portfolio is a portfolio application (resulting from a course given by Paul Hudson) to demonstrate iOS development proficiency and good coding practices.  The app is designed to track two major things: Projects and Items.  A project can have one or more items related to it.  This can be used for any purpose; to track a hobby i.e. running data in order to work up to a marathon, a shopping list, etc.  The app is not meant to showcase the best/flashiest UI possible, but moreso to demonstrate all around iOS feature and framework proficiency.
